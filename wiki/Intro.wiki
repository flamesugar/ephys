#summary An Electrophysiology toolbox for Matlab

= Introduction =

This is a new project to develop a robust, powerful, and dynamic Matlab toolbox for designing and running electrophysiology experiments.  This toolbox integrates with Tucker-Davis Technologies ([http://www.tdt.com tdt.com]) proprietary software and real-time stimulus generation and data acquisition hardware.


= Details =

This project is in its infancy but will eventually include software developed to run electrophysiolgy, behavior (operant conditioning and other paradigms), and combined behavior/electrophysiology experiments in conjunction with TDT software.

This project is handled by a subversioning system which can be accessed with software such as [http://tortoisesvn.net TortoiseSVN].
