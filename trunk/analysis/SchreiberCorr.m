%
% Implements spike-train reliability measure introduced by Schreiber et al,
% 2003.  An Rcorr approaching 1 indicates very high spike-time reliability
% across trials, whereas Rcorr approaching 0 indicates very poor
% reliability across trials.
% 
% S is an MxN matrix of binned data with N observations (trials) and M samples
% (bins).  Typically, the matrix S will aready have been convolved
% with a a gaussian window (see reference).
% 
% The optional output nRcorr is the correlation value based on a random
% permutation of S.  This value is affected by the total number of events
% (spikes) in S.  It may be useful to subtract nRcorr from Rcorr in order
% to correct for bias based on the number of spikes (untested suggestion).
